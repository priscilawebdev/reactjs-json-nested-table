# A simple hierarchy table from input data in .json format

Every item in json consists of it’s own data and array, which items represents child data.
Item’s data have a variable number of attributes (key: value) and item have a variable number of nested child items.
When you click on item, direct child items are hidden/shown.

## Setup

Setting up this repository to get going is extremely simple.

Assuming you already have installed Node and yarn/npm (if you don't, [check how to here](https://nodejs.org/en/)), all you'll need to do is:

* Open the terminal in the root folder of the project

* Install the dependencies:
```
yarn install or npm install
```

* Once all the dependencies are installed, just run, from the root folder:
```
yarn start or npm run start
```

Now you should be seeing the app running in your browser. :)
